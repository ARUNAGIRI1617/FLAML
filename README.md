In this fast Incrementing World everything changing to automation.Sorry! It's already changed a decade ago.Every manual works are changed to Automation in a glimpse. Example Network Automation,Security Automation,etc... Now the Revolutionary domain Machine Learning also  going to complete its transition to Automation.Now it's going to minimize all ML learners burden.Learners who are still got a dream to cherish in ML but allergic to algorithms gets scared  and switch their domain.To get rid from this allergy we can take measures like using FLAML
       
    
# FLAML
FLAML – Fast and Lightweight AutoML primarily developed by the team of Microsoft research. FLAML is one more contender in the open source Automl field.  Main use of this framework is that it selects all the learners and hyperparameters by itself. User don’t have to provide a list of parameters to run the model. FLAML favors the simple models at first and later penalizes it if the error is not getting reduced.
       
Unique thing about this framework is you can specify the time limit for how long the model should work and FLAML will try to find out all the possible algorithms and hyperparameters for that particular problem
       
# Features of FLAML
   
Easily find quality models with small computational resources for regression and classification.

It can be easily integrated with customised learners or metrics.

It uses a new, cost-effective hyperparameter optimization and learner (model) selection method invented by Microsoft Research.

It is highly customizable and doesn’t need meta-learning or ensemble modeling to generate good results.
